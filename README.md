# Factory Method (Creational Pattern)!

is used when you don't know yet what you are going to chose as an object of something (like you want to make a sandwich but don't know the ingerdiants) but still want to make the base for all of that 

so in this example i splitted the project into three parts which are:

1. SubClasses which are the object that you want to create but still couln't descide on the its peroperties
2. FactoryClass which is the factor method that is created to give the user the ability to create whaterver he wants.
3. UserClass which the main Program

i tried to be as simple as possible in this example

have fun!ðŸ˜‰
