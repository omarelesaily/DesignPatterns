# Factory Method (Creational Pattern)!


This approach is used when you havenâ€™t yet decided on the specific object you want to create (for example, you might want to make a sandwich but arenâ€™t sure of the ingredients yet), but you still want to establish a framework for it.

In this example, I've divided the project into three main parts:

SubClasses: These represent the objects you want to create but havenâ€™t finalized the properties for yet.
FactoryClass: This is the factory method that allows users to create any desired object.
UserClass: This is the main program that interacts with the factory.
I've kept the example as straightforward as possible.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜‰
