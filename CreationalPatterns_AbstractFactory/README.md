# Abstract Factory  (Creational Pattern)!

This pattern is used to create groups of related or dependent objects without specifying their exact classes.

In this example, the project is organized into three main components:

1. SubClasses: These represent the different families used in the abstract factory, such as (Arabian, Foreign) cuisine types.
2. FactoryClass: This is the factory interface that defines the primary methods for creating restaurant cuisines.
3. UserClass: This is the main program that interacts with the factory to utilize the created objects.
